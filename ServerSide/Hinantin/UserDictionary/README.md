### Installing the *User Distionary* on Ubuntu 12.04

##### Step 1. Install MySQL

```
$ sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.5
```

Once you have entered the password for sudo access, the installation will 
proceed. The only thing it will ask you is what to set the root password for 
MySQL as. You **SHOULD** set a password up, donâ€™t leave it blank with the intention 
of doing it later. I would recommend you find a decent password generator too
(i.e. https://strongpasswordgenerator.com/).

##### Step 2. Create the HNTUserDictionary Database and User 

Log into MySQL:

```
$ mysql -u root -p
Enter password: 
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 49
Server version: 5.5.40-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 (Ubuntu)
